Question: what is Full Stack Development?
Answer:"Full stack" refers to the entire spectrum of software development covering both the front-end (user interface) and the back-end (server, database, and application infrastructure). A full-stack developer is proficient in creating and managing the user-facing parts of an application, the underlying logic and operations, databases, and sometimes even server and deployment architecture. In essence, they're capable of building a software application from start to finish.

Question:what is Block chain?
Answer: Blockchain is a decentralised and distributed digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers or nodes. It is designed to be transparent, secure, and tamper-resistant. Each transaction, or "block," is linked to the previous one, forming a chain of blocks, hence the name "blockchain."
In ligament terms, blockchain technology may not have a direct application. However, in the broader field of healthcare, blockchain has the potential to enhance data security, interoperability, and privacy. For example, blockchain can be used to securely store and share medical records, ensuring that patient data remains confidential and tamper-proof. It can also facilitate the secure exchange of medical research data, enable supply chain tracking of medical devices, and streamline insurance claims processing.
While blockchain technology is not specifically related to ligaments, it has the potential to revolutionise various aspects of healthcare by providing a secure and transparent platform for data management and collaboration.
